CleanCity – Smart Municipal Reporting Portal
CleanCity is a modern web application that empowers citizens to report cleanliness issues directly to their municipality — quickly, visually, and transparently. With an elegant UI, smooth animations, image-based reporting, and an intuitive admin dashboard, CleanCity makes community cleanliness collaborative and efficient.
This project demonstrates a fully functional front-end reporting system using LocalStorage as a lightweight database. It includes a citizen panel, an admin panel, status verification, and real-time issue feeds.
